			<h1> About </h1>
			<p> This site is intended as a guide for the underground-only
				survival challenge in Minecraft. In addition to a walkthrough,
				it provides a full list of chest loot for every underground
				structure, and a partial list of blocks and crafting materials
				that are obtainable. </p>
			<p> This guide will primarily focus on the Java Edition, since
				that's the version I have the most experience with, but I 
				will make note of differences between the Java and Bedrock
				Editions wherever I am aware of them. </p>
			<p> The title, Order of the Stone, comes from the original subtitle
				of the Minecraft game when it was first created - Minecraft: Order of the Stone. </p>
