				<h2> Cave Biomes </h2>
				<p> If you go far enough underground, most places look the same no matter what the
					surface looks like. Minecraft has three cave biomes, though, which help to break up
					this monotony by providing different environments. </p>
				<section id="lush-caves" class="odd">
					<h3> Lush Caves </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a Lush Cave" src="images/game_screenshots/lush_cave.png" />
					<p> Lush Caves are one of your primary sources of wood in this challenge, due to the
						native Azalea trees being the only renewable source.
						In addition to Azalea trees, Lush Caves feature clay pools with dripleaves,
						large patches of moss with azaleas, and hanging vines with and without Glow Berries.
						They are also the only place to find Axolotls, and the only reliable place 
						to find Tropical Fish underground. </p>
					<p> Lush Caves generate about 25 to 115 blocks below the surface, in places with high humidity.
						Usually the surface in such locations has a heavily wooded biome such as Jungle
						or Old Growth Taiga, but it can also be a Desert (since in Minecraft deserts are defined by
						high temperature instead of low humidity) or an Ocean. Lush Caves are the only cave biome that
						can generate below an Ocean. </p>
					<p> Lush Caves are safer from hostile mobs than most places underground,
						seeing as both the prevalent water and the light from the Glow Berries inhibit
						their spawning. But these features also make Lush Caves difficult to traverse:
						water slows your movement and can only be exited onto blocks that are flush with 
						or below the surface, and vines inhibit visibility wherever there are low ceilings.
						The dripleaves are a double-edged sword when it comes to movement. They can be
						jumped on top of to climb out of the water pools, but they collapse when stepped
						on. But the top can't be walked through when it isn't collapsed, which can be a
						problem when two- or three-block tall dripleaves (which are too tall to jump on)
						grow on the edges of the pools. </p>
					<p> Mining is more difficult in Lush Caves. In the caves themselves,
						the sheer amount of decoration can make ores difficult to spot.
						The ever-present water slows down not just movement, but also mining if
						the player's head is underwater or their feet aren't touching the ground.
						Finally, clay is tedious to remove since it drops multiple items when broken,
						and can't be converted into moss. </p>
				</section>
				<section id="dripstone-caves" class="even">
					<h3> Dripstone Caves </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a Dripstone Cave" src="images/game_screenshots/dripstone_cave.png">
					<p> Compared to the other two cave biomes, Dripstone Caves look the most like regular Caves
						that aren't part of a cave biome. The primary difference is the presence of stalactites
						and stalagmites made of Dripstone, which may have small pools of water mixed in on the floor.
						Dripstone Caves also feature increased amounts of Copper Ore and naturally spawning
						<a href="mobs.html#drowned">Drowned</a>.
						</p>
					<p> Dripstone Caves generate about 25 to 115 blocks below the surface, 
						in places that are very far inland. </p>
					<p> In theory I expect Dripstone Caves to be more dangerous than other caves, but I don't know
						from experience since I haven't spent much time there. Dripstone stalagmites double
						fall damage when landed on, and stalactites can fall, dealing heavy damage on impact, if their 
						support blocks are removed.	Stalactites also fall when hit with a trident, which is the
						weapon of choice for Drowned mobs, which can spawn here. So while again, I haven't spent
						much time in the Dripstone Caves, the biome's unique features appear to up the danger level 
						somewhat. </p>
				</section>
				<section id="deep-dark" class="odd">
					<h3> Deep Dark </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of the Deep Dark" src="images/game_screenshots/deep_dark.png">
					<p> The Deep Dark is the creepiest and possibly the most dangerous cave biome. It can be
						identified by the presence of Sculk, which makes up most of the biome. As a biome, the Deep Dark
						isn't terribly interesting, as the various Sculk blocks are the only unique generated feature. 
						But it does have a complete lack of mobs other than the Warden, and is the only place to find
						Ancient Cities. </p>
					<p> The Deep Dark generates about 140 or more blocks below the surface, in areas with low erosion.
						Seeing as the bottom of the world is only 126 blocks below sea level, the Deep Dark will be
						primarily found where the surface has high elevation. </p>
					<p> Surviving the Deep Dark requires different skills than anywhere else in Minecraft.
						The primary threat is the Sculk Shriekers that can be found dotted around:
						if a player steps on them or activates a nearby Sculk Sensor, they let out a loud
						shriek, give the player the Darkness effect (which hinders vision), and if four were
						activated within a few minutes, causes <a href="mobs.html#warden">the Warden</a> to spawn. 
						Sculk Sensors can be activated by many common player actions, including eating, walking without
						sneaking, firing a bow, dropping any item that isn't wool, or breaking or placing any block that
						isn't wool, meaning the player must remain vigilant in order to avoid activating any Sensors. 
						Survival is primarily oriented around avoiding or breaking the Shriekers. Areas devoid of 
						Shriekers are a good place to live due to the lack of hostile mobs. </p>
				</section>

			<section id="underground-structures">
				<h2> Underground Structures </h3>
				<section id="mineshaft" class="odd">
					<h3> Abandoned Mineshaft </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of an Abandoned Mineshaft" src="images/game_screenshots/abandoned_mineshaft.png">
					<p> Abandoned Mineshafts are the other common source of underground wood besides Lush Caves.
						(Up to 57% of the wood is in the form of fence posts, which are useless for crafting,
						but there is so much present that it doesn't matter.)</p>
					<p> Mineshafts consist mostly of three-block wide tunnels with wooden support beams, and are
						commonly decorated with cobwebs, torches, and broken Minecart tracks. When the tunnels
						intersect caves, they generate a bridge of wood planks which may be supported by chains
						above or log pillars below. Chest minecarts	can be found on some of the tracks, and 
						<a href="mobs.html#cave-spider">Cave Spider</a> spawners occupy some of the tunnels. 
						Tunnels with Cave Spider spawners are obstructed by a large number of cobwebs. </p>
					<p> Fully exploring and lighting a Mineshaft can be a major chore due to their size, the
						difficulty of navigating often tight spaces containing cobwebs, and of course the Cave 
						Spiders. It is worth it, though, as they have a large surface area that exposes
						significantly more ore than caves do, and there's also the chest loot to look forward to,
						and the wood to collect. Even the Cave Spider spawners provide benefit to the player
						once the shaft is lit, since they can be used to make a string farm. More spawners close
						together make a better farm; double spawners aren't that uncommon. </p>
					<p> Mineshafts generate in every biome except Deep Dark, though those that generate in one of
						the three Badlands (Mesa) biomes are Mesa mineshafts. Normal mineshafts have oak wood and
						are found at all heights below sea level, and Mesa mineshafts have dark oak wood and are 
						found between sea level and the world surface (if higher). </p>
					<p> The chest minecart loot is listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#mineshaft">Chest Loot</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="ancient-city" class="even">
					<h3> Ancient City </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of an Ancient City" src="images/game_screenshots/ancient_city.png">
					<p> Ancient Cities are a massive structure found at Y -51 in the Deep Dark. The majority
						of the structure is formed from Deepslate and Basalt, but there is a significant amount
						of Wool and Dark Oak wood as well. From the city center containing of a giant statue 
						of the Warden and a hidden redstone lab, passages with a floor of Wool branch out. 
						Various smaller structures are found along the sides of the passages. Some of these 
						smaller	structures have loot chests; however, the ones with loot chests tend to also 
						have Sculk Sensors and Shriekers. </p>
					<p> Ancient Cities are the only place where you can find Skeleton Skulls; they are also
						the only place in the Overworld where there is Soul Sand or Soil (typically Nether 
						resources), and the chest loot has several other unique items. The chest loot is
						listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#ancient-city">Chest Loot</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="stronghold" class="odd">
					<h3> Stronghold </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a Stronghold crossing and portal room" src="images/game_screenshots/stronghold.png">
					<p> Strongholds are a rare underground structure, and the only Overworld structure that is mandatory to
						visit in order to reach the Ender Dragon. They can be located using Eyes of Ender; see 
						<a href="walkthrough.html#finding-strongholds"> Walkthrough/Finding Strongholds </a>.</p>
					<p> Strongholds take the form of a dungeon made from Stone Bricks, mostly divided into short three-block
						wide corridors and occasional larger rooms. The most important room is the End Portal room, followed 
						by the libraries (which there are usually two of). Loot can be found in chests in the library (one on
						each floor of two-story libraries), on slab altars in some corridors, and in the crossing room variant
						with a low wooden ceiling, on top of the ceiling. </p>
					<p> Strongholds are infested with <a href="mobs.html#silverfish">Silverfish</a>. 10% of all Stone Brick
						blocks have Silverfish in them which come out and attack when the block is broken without Silk Touch
						or when another Silverfish is attacked, and there is a spawner in the End Portal room. The player 
						being swarmed by Silverfish is consequently very likely. Most of the stronghold can be navigated 
						without breaking blocks, with the sole exception that the five-way crossing room (the one with a 
						bridge made of smooth stone slabs) can sometimes block off the side exits with indistinct walls. </p>
					<p> Interestingly, strongholds are placed in the world in a different way than any other structure. 
						In Java Edition, each world has exactly 128 strongholds, generated in eight rings around the origin.
						The smallest ring contains three strongholds, each of which are generated between 1280 and 2816 blocks
						from the origin, and the largest ring has nine strongholds between 22784 and 24320 blocks from the
						origin. In Bedrock Edition, strongholds generate randomly like any other structure, except for the 
						addition of three strongholds fairly close to the origin, which have villages above them on the 
						surface. </p>
					<p> The chest loot is listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#stronghold">Chest Loot</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="ruined-portal" class="even">
					<h3> Ruined Portal </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of an underground Ruined Portal" src="images/game_screenshots/underground_ruined_portal.png">
					<p> Ruined Portals are a small Stone Brick structure containing a damaged Nether Portal frame. 
						In addition to the frame, there is a chest with gold and fire related items, and there may
						or may not be one or more Gold Blocks. Additionally, Ruined Portals generate a patch of 
						Netherrack, Lava, and Magma Block that spreads through the terrain. </p>
					<p> Ruined Portals generate with 15-20% Crying Obsidian, but Nether Portals can only be built 
						with regular Obsidian, not Crying Obsidian. Often Ruined Portals are larger than the 
						minimum size for a Nether Portal, though, and the chest can also have Obsidian, so using a
						Diamond Pickaxe it is sometimes possible to mine the regular Obsidian and build a working 
						Nether Portal with it. </p>
					<p> Most Ruined Portals are found on the surface, but they can be occasionally found 
						underground, too. In biomes with the Mountain variant (specifically Windswept Hills and 
						its variants, Stony Shore, Savanna Plateau, Windswept Savanna, Wooded Badlands, and Eroded
						Badlands), underground Ruined Portals generate above Y:70; in other biomes in which there 
						can be underground Ruined Portals, they generate above Y:-49 (including in the previous 
						range). Ruined Portals are never found underground in Deserts, any of the nine Ocean
						biomes, any of the three Jungle biomes, or either of the two Swamp biomes.</p>
					<p> The chest loot is listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#ruined-portal">Chest Loot</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="monster-room" class="odd">
					<h3> Monster Room </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a Monster Room with a Zombie spawner" src="images/game_screenshots/monster_room.png">
					<p> Monster Rooms are small cobblestone rooms with up to two loot chests and a mob spawner.
					They are commonly found attached to larger structures, such as Strongholds and Abandoned
					Mineshafts. The spawner inside is useful for making a mob farm, provided you don't break
					it. 50% of Monster Rooms have a <a href="mobs.html#zombie">Zombie</a> spawner, 25% have
					a <a href="mobs.html#skeleton">Skeleton</a> spawner, and 25% have a 
					<a href="mobs.html#spider">Spider</a> spawner. </p>
					<p> Technically, Monster Rooms are features and not structures, so they still generate
					even if Generate Structures was turned off in the world settings. In every Overworld
					biome, the game tries to place a Monster Room ten times per chunk above Y:0 and four times
					below Y:0, but it only succeeds if the potential Room would have a solid ceiling and floor, 
					and at least one entrance at floor level. This makes Monster Rooms fairly uncommon, and 
					always attached to a cave or another structure. </p>
					<p> The chest loot is listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#monster-room">Chest Loot</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="amethyst-geode" class="even">
					<h3> Amethyst Geode </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of an Amethyst Geode" src="images/game_screenshots/amethyst_geode.png">
					<p> Amethyst Geodes are a round hollow feature made of Smooth Basalt, Calcite, and Amethyst 
						blocks. They are the only place where there are Budding Amethyst blocks, which gradually 
						grow Amethyst Clusters on every unobstructed side, but can't be moved. Budding Amethyst
						can be distinguished from regular Amethyst blocks by the large "X" on the side. </p>
					<p> There is an Amethyst Geode in one of every 64 chunks. They are features not structures,
						so they still generate even if Generate Structures was turned off in the world settings. </p>
				</section>
				<section id="ore-vein" class="odd">
					<h3> Ore Vein </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a copper Ore Vein" src="images/game_screenshots/copper_ore_vein.png">
					<p> Ore Veins are long, snakelike veins of metal ore that generate underground, potentially
						containing hundreds to thousands of ore. Besides the regular ore, they also contain the
						block of raw ore, and a corresponding stone type, which makes up a majority of the blocks
						in the vein. Copper ore veins generate between Y:0 and Y:50 and have granite as
						their stone type, while iron ore veins generate between Y:-60 and Y:-8 and have tuff as
						their stone type. There are no gold ore veins. </p>
					<p> Ore veins are technically neither a structure nor a feature, but are generated in a
						similar way to noise caves, a relationship that is revealed by comparing their shape
						to that of caves. Since they are not structures, they still generate even if Generate 
						Structures was turned off in the world settings. </p>
				</section>
				<section id="fossil" class="even">
					<h3> Fossil </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a Fossil in a flooded cave" src="images/game_screenshots/underwater_fossil.png">
					<p> Fossils are small underground features made from Bone Blocks and Coal Ore (above Y:0)
						or Deepslate Diamond Ore (below Y:-8). There are four skull structures and four spine
						structures. </p>
					<p> Fossils generate below Deserts, Swamps, and Mangrove Swamps. They can generate at any
						elevation except the range from Y:-8 to Y:0. Since they are features not structures,
						they still generate even if Generate Structures was turned off in the world settings. </p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="surface-structures">
				<h2> Surface Structures with Underground Portions </h2>
				<p> These structures generate either on, over, or embedded in the surface of the world,
					but some significant portion of each commonly generates underground. </p>
				<section id="trail-ruin" class="odd">
					<h3> Trail Ruins </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of an excavated Trail Ruin" src="images/game_screenshots/excavated_trail_ruin.png">
					<p> Trail Ruins are the buried remains of ancient villages. The majority of the structure
						is underground, but there is a tower at the center whose peak pierces the surface. On
						Bedrock Edition, the tower peak may be separated from the remainder of the tower by
						several layers of stone. Trail Ruins are comprised mostly of Bricks, Mud Bricks, 
						Terracotta, and Cobblestone. </p>
					<p> Every open space in the structure is filled with a mixture of Dirt, Coarse Dirt,
						Gravel, and Suspicious Gravel. There are no loot chests, but a range of items
						can be obtained by brushing the Suspicious Gravel, several of which aren't found
						anywhere else. Care must be taken, because if the Suspicious Gravel falls or is 
						broken, the item inside is destroyed. Suspicious Gravel can be distinguished from
						regular Gravel by the dark spot in the middle.</p>
					<p> The items that can be obtained from suspicious gravel are listed at 
						<a href="structure_loot.html#trail-ruin">Archaeology Loot</a>.</p>

				<section id="igloo" class="even">
					<h3> Igloo </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of an Igloo basement" src="images/game_screenshots/igloo_basement.png">
					<p> Igloos commonly have a hidden basement 21 blocks below the floor, accessed via a ladder.
						The basement is made of stone bricks with some Silverfish, and contains a cobweb, a
						cactus, a cauldron, a brewing stand with a weakness splash potion, a 
						<a href="mobs.html#villager">Villager</a>, a 
						<a href="mobs.html#zombie_villager">Zombie Villager</a>, and a loot chest. </p>
					<p> Igloos generate in Snowy Plains, Snowy Taiga, and Snowy Slopes. </p>
					<p> The chest loot is listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#igloo">Chest Loot</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="desert-pyramid" class="odd">
					<h3> Desert Pyramid </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a Desert Pyramid basement" src="images/game_screenshots/desert_temple_basement.png">
					<p> Desert Pyramids have a sealed basement 12 blocks below the main floor, with a TNT
						booby trap and four loot chests. The trap is triggered by the stone pressure plate
						in the center of the room, and can be disabled by breaking the plate. </p>
					<p> New to the latest update, there is a second hidden room in the main floor which is 
						filled with Sand and Suspicious Sand. Like in the <a href="#trail-ruin">Trail Ruins</a>, items can be obtained
						by brushing the Suspicious Sand, which can be distinguished from regular Sand by its 
						rougher texture.</p>
					<p> The chest contents are listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#desert-pyramid">Chest Loot</a>.

					<img alt="Screenshot of a Jungle Temple basement" src="images/game_screenshots/jungle_temple_basement.png">
					<p> Jungle Temples have a basement 4 blocks below the main floor.
						Depending on the terrain, the basement may be either slightly
						below ground level, or partially above the ground. </p>
					<p> The Jungle Temple basement has a lever puzzle that opens a hidden
						room on the main floor with a loot chest, and there is a second
						chest guarded by two arrow traps triggered by tripwires. </p>
					<p> The chest contents are listed at <a href="structure_loot.html#jungle-pyramid">Chest Loot</a>.</p>

					<h3> Shipwreck </h3>
					<img alt="Screenshot of a beached Shipwreck" src="images/game_screenshots/beached_shipwreck.png">
					<p> Shipwrecks usually generate out in the ocean, but sometimes they are
						found embedded in the ground on beaches. The wood types they are made
						of are random, either the front or back half of the ship may be missing, 
						and they can be turned upside down or onto their side. </p>
					<p> There are three potential loot chests: the supply chest in the bow,

						for the chest to generate a ways out to sea, in which case
						there will be at least one block above it, but said block
						may not be sand.</p>
